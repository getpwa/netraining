<b><u>Android Data Storage:</u></b><br>
Android provides several options for you to save persistent application data.<br>
It totally depends on our needs, which storage option we want to select to store data.<br><hr><hr>
<b>The data storage options in Android are:-</b><br>
<b>Shared Preferences:</b><br>Store private primitive data in key-value pairs.<br>
Thus whenever we want to retrieve the data we give the "Key" to the database and getting the corresponding "value" of it from the database.<br>
E.g. storing data as 
"Username":"Arjun"
"Password":"xyz_123".
Now, for retriving we would just feed the database with a key , here it is "Username" and would get the corresponding value of it i.e."Arjun".<br>
<hr>
<b>Internal Storage:</b><br>Store private data on the device memory.<br>
<hr>
<b>External Storage:</b><br>Store public data on the shared external storage.<br>
<hr>
<b>SQLite Databases:</b><br>Store structured data in a private database.<br>
For storing data in the form of related tables.
<hr>
<b>Network Connection:</b><br>Store data on the web with your own network server.<br><br>
