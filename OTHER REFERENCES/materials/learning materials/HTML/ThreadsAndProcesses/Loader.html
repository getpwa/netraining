<b><u>Loaders :-</u></b><br>
Android introduced Loader API in API Level 11 which consists of multiple classes and interfaces when using loaders in the app.<br><hr><hr>

<b>Loaders:</b><br>
Loaders perform the loading of data. This class is abstract and serves as the base class for all loaders.<br>
It is a generic type class that exposes one generic type argument.<br>
<div>
<pre>
<code>
public class Loader &lt;DataType&gt;
</code>
</pre>
</div><br>

<b>Note:</b><br>
Loader by itself does not have the ability to asynchronously load data.<br>
It is the AsyncTaskLoader subclass of Loader which provides an AsyncTask to perform load operations on a separate thread.<br>
CursorLoader subclass of AsyncTaskLoader is used for asynchronously loading data from a ContentProvider. It queries a ContentResolver and returns a Cursor.<br><hr><hr>

<b>Advantages of Using Loaders:</b>
<ol>
<li>AsyncTaskLoader overcomes the limitations of an Asynctask by managing the Thread and UI Thread in Activity and Fragment Lifecycle events.</li>
<li>At time of device configuration changes such as rotation of the screen involve restarting your whole Activity.
The best part about Loaders is that Loaders survive configuration changes.It can cache results across configuration changes to prevent duplicate queries. </li>
<li>Loaders simplify thread management by providing callback methods when events occur.</li>
<li>Loaders can implement an observer to monitor for changes in the underlying data source. 
For example, CursorLoader automatically registers a ContentObserver to trigger a reload when data changes.</li>
<li>Loaders dont stay forever. Theyâ€™ll be automatically cleaned up when the requesting Activity or Fragment is permanently destroyed.</li>
</ol>

<b>LoaderManager:</b><br>
LoaderManager is responsible for managing one or more Loaders associated with an Activity or Fragment.<br> <br>

<b>Note:</b><br>
There is only one LoaderManager per activity or fragment , but a LoaderManager can manage multiple loaders.<br>
A LoaderManager is in charge of starting, stopping, retaining, restarting, and destroying its Loaders by calling its corresponding methods.<br>
Thus whenever an Activity or a fragment is destroyed , it instructs its LoaderManager to destroy and close its Loaders (as well as any resources associated with them, such as a Cursor).<br>
The LoaderManager is also responsible for retaining your data on configuration changes like a change of orientation and it calls the relevant callback methods when the data changes.<br><br>

To initiate LoaderManager , we call getLoaderManager()/getSupportLoaderManager() from within your activity or your fragment.<br>
They are 2 main methods of the LoaderManager:
<ol>
<li>initLoader(): <br>
It is used to initialize a Loader within the activity's onCreate() method, or within the fragment's onActivityCreated() method.</li>
<div>
<pre>
<code>
getLoaderManager().initLoader(LOADER_ID,null, this);
</code>
</pre>
</div>
It takes 3 arguments:<br>
A unique ID that identifies the loader.<br>
An optional Bundle with args for your Loader if needed.<br>
A LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks implementation, which the LoaderManager calls to report loader events. In this example, the local class implements the LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks interface, so it passes a reference to itself, this.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b><br>
If the loader specified by the ID already exists, the last created loader is reused.<br>
If the loader specified by the ID does not exist, initLoader() triggers the LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks method onCreateLoader() where we write the code to instantiate and return a new loader.<br><br>

<li>restartLoader():</li>
Since initLoader() uses an existing loader with a specified ID if it was created previous, it doesnt discard the old data.<br>  
But sometimes you want to discard your old data and start over.<br>
Thus restartLoader() is used to reset the Loaders when the Query changes, thus discarding the old data.<br> 
It takes the same arguments as initLoader() and you must use the same ID used to initialize the Loader in the first place.<br>
<div>
<pre>
<code>
getLoaderManager().restartLoader(LOADER_ID, null, this);
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</ol><hr><hr>

<b>LoaderCallbacks:</b><br>
To interact with the loader manager, the client (Activity or Fragment) needs to implement certain LoaderCallback&lt;D&gt; Interface.<br>
The following functions have to be implemented by the user.<br><br>
onCreateLoader(int, Bundle) - <br>called when the system needs a new loader to be created. Your code should create a Loader object and return it to the system.<br><br>
onLoadFinished(Loader&lt;D&gt;, D) - <br>called when a loader has finished loading data. Typically, your code should display the data to the user.<br><br>
onLoaderReset(Loader&lt;D&gt;) - <br>called when a previously created loader is being reset (when you call destroyLoader(int) or when the activity or fragment is destroyed , and thus making its data unavailable. 
Your code should remove any references it has to the loader's data.<br><hr><br><br>
