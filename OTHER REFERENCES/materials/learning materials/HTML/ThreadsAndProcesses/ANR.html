<b><u>Main/UI Thread</u>:-</b><br>
All apps, when started, run in a single Main thread. It’s also known as the User Interface (or UI) thread.<br>
<i id="font">All components that run in the same process run in this thread.</i><br><br>

But,blocking UI thread by running everything in it will result in  poor response times and the display of the dreaded Application Not Responding(ANR) dialog.

<b><u>ANR (Application Not Responding) is triggered when</u>:-</b>
<ol>
	<li>If an app can’t respond to user input within 5 seconds.</li>
	<li>If Broadcast receivers haven’t finished executing within 10 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<b><u>Measures for avoiding ANR</u>:-</b>
<ol>
	<li>Do less work as much as possible on the Activity's main thead.</li>
	<li>Use separate threads for executing long running operations like database transactions, file downloading,complex calculations etc.
		There are various alternatives available in Android for moving our processing to the background thread :-</li>
	<ol type='a'>
		<li>Use your own Threads and use the Handler class to notify the main thread when the work is done</li>
		<li>Use the AsyncTask class to do the work in the background</li>
		<li>Use Loaders for asynchronous data loading</li>
		<li>Use IntentService for background services performing set tasks like internet updates or data processing.</li>
	</ol>
