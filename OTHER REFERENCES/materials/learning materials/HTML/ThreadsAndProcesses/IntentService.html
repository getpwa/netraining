<b><u>IntentService :-</u></b><br>
IntentService is a Service which runs in a separate worker thread.<br>
Thus ,IntentService can be defined as a long running background process without any user interaction running in a separate thread.<br>
It helps us to achieve parallelism in Android by automatically handling the long-running operations without affecting responsiveness of our UI.<br>
It is normally used when there is no communication needed back to the main thread after the completion of the process.<br>

<b>How Intent Service Works?</b><br>
Clients send requests through startService(Intent).<br>
The IntentService handles each Intent using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.<br>
Only one instance of a IntentService can run at the same time, thus all the subsequent calls to the IntentService is queued on the same worker thread.<br><hr><hr>

			   
<b>Note:-</b><br>
Asynctask are not aware of the activity or fragment lifecycle and so it is the programmer's responsibility to handle the AsyncTasks behaviour when the activity is destroyed.<br>
Thus, if we are running a long running background process (like downloading a song,file) if the app is in the background and the app is terminated by Android, your background processing is also terminated.<br>
While an IntentService isn't affected by most user interface lifecycle events, so it continues to run in circumstances that would shut down an AsyncTask.<br><hr><hr>

<b>Difference between Service and IntentService:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Service class uses the application's main thread, while IntentService creates a worker thread and uses that thread to run the service.</li>
<li>Service class needs a manual stop using stopSelf(). Meanwhile, IntentService automatically stops itself when there is no intent in queue, all queued intents are handled. </li>
</ul><br><hr><hr>

<b>Steps of Implementing Intent Service:</b><br> 
1. Create a new Class Extening Intent Service. Override the onHandleIntent() method and Create a Default Constructor.
<div>
<pre>
<code>
public class MyService extends IntentService {
    public MyService(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onHandleIntent(@Nullable Intent intent) {
        // Gets data from the incoming Intent
        String dataString = intent.getDataString();
        ...
        // Do work here, based on the contents of dataString
        ...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
</div><br><br>

2. Create an entry in AndroidManifest.xml file
<div>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;application
        android:icon=&quot;@drawable/icon&quot;
        android:label=&quot;@string/app_name&quot;&gt;
        ...
        &lt;!--
            Because android:exported is set to &quot;false&quot;,
            the service is only available to this app.
        --&gt;
        &lt;service
            android:name=&quot;.MyService&quot;
            android:exported=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
        ...
&lt;application/&gt;
</code>
</pre>
</div><br><hr><br><br>
