<b><u>Job Schedular :-</u></b><br>
Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) introduced JobScheduler API that let developers improve app's performance considerably along with 
optimizing battery life by scheduling a task /job to run under specified conditions.<br><hr>
<b>Note:-</b><br>
Alarm Manager API is used for scheduling tasks that are meant to be run at a specified  time.<br>
While JobScheduler is used to schedule tasks which are meant to be run for most robust conditions which can help us to optimize battery life.<br><hr><hr>

<b>When to use JobScheduler:</b>
<ul>
<li>Tasks that should be done once the device is connect to a power supply, connected to a wifi , device is in idle state etc etc</li>
<li>Task that are not critical and need to be scheduled at an exact specified time</li>
<li>Tasks that should be running on a regular basis as batch where the timing is not critical</li>
</ul>
<hr><hr>

<b>Creating Job Objects:-</b><br>
JobInfo is a container for data passed to the JobScheduler.<br>
It encapsulates all the information about the work you want to accomplish and the conditions of its execution (time, power availability, etc). <br> 
JobInfo isn’t the actual work or task itself.  The actual work to be accomplished is defined in a class which extends JobService.  <br>
The JobInfo just represents the parameters or criteria about when you want the work to execute.  <br>
It is in the JobInfo object, for example, that you specify that a big downloading job is to run when the device is plugged in and has a WIFI connection
The <i class="myfont">JobInfo.Builder</i> class is used to initialize a new Job objects.<br><hr><hr>
<div>
<pre>
<code>
JobInfo.Builder builder = new JobInfo.Builder (int jobId, ComponentName jobService);
//Set conditions for scheduling the jobs
</code>
</pre>
</div><br>
<b>Attributes:</b><br>
int jobId :<br>
 Application-provided id for this job. Subsequent calls to cancel, or jobs created with the same jobId, will update the pre-existing job with the same id.<br> 
 This ID must be unique across all clients of the same uid (not just the same package).<br><br>
ComponentName jobService :<br>
 The endpoint that you implement that will receive the callback from the JobScheduler.<br>
This value must never be null.<br><hr><hr>

<b>JobService:</b><br>
JobService is a long running running background process responsible for execution of our job.<br>
It extends from Service class.Thus by default it runs on Main UI Thread.<br>
Hence we need to offload your execution logic to another thread/handler/AsyncTask.<br>
Steps of creating the Service:
<ol>
<li>Create a class that extends JobService Class.</li>
<li>Override and implement its methods:</li>
	<ol value="a">
	<li>onStartJob:</li>
	The onStartJob( ) method gets called when the job is started.<br>
	The onStartJob( ) method runs on the main / UI thread.  <br>
	It is typically in this method , we create another thread for running the processing of our job. <br> 
	The onStartJob( ) method returns a Boolean true if the process runs on another thread. In that case we need to call onJobFinished() method from that thread , to tell the system
	that the job has finished.If onStartJob() returns false that means there is no more work to be done for the job.<br>

	<li>onStopJob:</li>
	The onStopJob( ) method gets called when the job is stopped by the system when the criteria or parameters associated with your job via the JobInfo no longer apply.<br>
	For example, if you specified in your JobInfo that the job must have wifi access to run,  yet while your job was executing the user toggled WiFi.<br>
	At that time onStopJob( ) will be called since the requirements specified at schedule time are no longer met.<br>    
	This method also executes on the main / UI thread.  <br>
	The onStopJob( ) method also returns a Boolean.<br>
	True to indicate whether you would like the job to rescheduled / retried when conditions are right again.False to drop the job.<br>

	<li>onJobFinished:</li>
	We cannot override this metohd.  The final jobFinished( ) method must be called by your code when your job is done executing.<br>  
	This notifies the system’s "JobManager" that it is finished so that it no longer needs to be managed, rescheduled, etc. <br>
	One of the parameters (a Boolean true) to jobFinished( ) allows you to indicate that you want the job to be rescheduled according to the back-off criteria.<br>
	</ol>
	
<li>Add the permission android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE into your service manifest declaration</li>
<div>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;service android:name=&quot;MyJobService&quot;
              android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE&quot; &gt;
</code>
</pre>
</div>
<li>Scheduling the Job:</li>
Create an Instance of Job Schedular System Service:
<div>
<pre>
<code>
final JobScheduler jobScheduler = (JobScheduler) getSystemService(Context.JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE);
</code>
</pre>
</div><br>

Pass the JobInfo object to the schedule method:
<div>
<pre>
<code>
jobScheduler.schedule(builder.build());
</code>
</pre>
</div>
</ol>
