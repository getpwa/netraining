<b><u>Thread</u>:-</b><br>
<i id="font">A thread is a single sequential flow of control(thread of execution) within a program.</i><br><hr><hr>

<b><u>Threads in Java</u>:-</b><br>
In Java, JVM allows an application to run multiple thread simultaneously and also allows us to set priority of each thread.<br>
<i id="font">Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority.</i> <br><br>
When code running in some thread creates a new Thread object, the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating thread is a daemon.
<br><hr><hr>

There are two ways to create a new thread of execution:<br><br>
1. One is to declare a class to be a subclass of Thread.<br>
This subclass should override the run method of class Thread.<br>
An instance of the subclass can then be allocated and started.
<div>
<pre>
<code>
    class MyThreadClass extends Thread{

    public void run() {
    //Code to be executed in a Thread
    goTosleep();
    }
    }

    private void goTosleep() {
    try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    }
    }
</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br>

To Call the Thread :-
<div>
<pre>
<code>
    MyThreadClass mythread = new MyThreadClass();
    mythread.start();
</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br><hr><br>
The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that implements the Runnable interface.<br>
That class then implements the run method. An instance of the class can then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating Thread, and started. <br>
The same example in this other style looks like the following:<br>
<div>
<pre>
<code>
    class MyThreadClass implements Runnable{

    public void run() {
    //Code to be executed in a Thread
    goTosleep();
    }
    }

    private void goTosleep() {
    try {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    }
    }
</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br>
The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
<div>
<pre>
<code>
    MyThreadClass myThreadClass = new MyThreadClass();
    new Thread(myThreadClass).start();
</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br>
<b><u>Note</u>:-</b><br>
<i>Java threads are one-time use only and die after executing its run method.</i><br><hr><br><br>
