<i class="font">Android Application code by default runs in a single thread called as Main thread or UI
    thread.</i><br><br>
Since all the codes are running in a single thread every statement gets executed in sequence.<br>
Thus if we perform a long lasting operation, the application blocks the thread until the
corresponding operation has been finished.<br>
Hence it is better to perform such long lasting operations asynchronously.<br><br>
<i class="font">An asynchronous task is defined by a computation that runs on a background thread and
    whose result is published on the UI thread.</i><br>
<hr>
<hr>
<b><u>Note</u>:-</b><br>
If an activity does not react within 5 seconds to user input, the Android system displays an
Application Not Responding (ANR) dialog.

<br>
<b><u>Asynctask</u>:-</b><br>
AsyncTask is one of the easiest ways to implement parallelism in Android without having to deal with
more complex methods like Threads.
Though it offers a basic level of parallelism with the UI thread, it should not be used for longer
operations lasting more than few seconds.

<br>
<hr>
<hr>
<b>AsyncTask has four methods to do the task</b>:-<br>
<b class="font"><u>onPreExecute()</u></b>:- <br>
This method contains the code which is executed before the background processing starts.<br><br>
<hr>
<b class="font"><u>doInBackground()</u></b>:-<br>
This method contains the code which needs to be executed in background. In this method we can send
results multiple times to the UI thread by publishProgress() method. To notify that the background
processing has been completed we just need to use the return statements.<br><br>
<hr>
<b class="font"><u>onProgressUpdate()</u></b>:-<br>
This method receives progress updates from doInBackground method, which is published via
publishProgress method, and this method can use this progress update to update the UI
thread.<br><br>
<hr>
<b class="font"><u>onPostExecute()</u></b>:-<br>
This method is called after doInBackground method completes processing. Result from doInBackground
is passed to this method.<br><br>
<hr>
<br>
<i class="font">doInBackground() is the most important as it is where background computations are
    performed.</i><br><br>
<i class="font">doInBackground() works as a background thread, while other works in the UI
    Thread.
    Thus it is not possible to access an UI element in doInBackground().</i><br>
<hr>
<hr>

<i>AsyncTask must be subclassed to be used.</i><br><br>
The three generic types used in an android AsyncTask class are given below :<br>
<i class="font"><u>Params</u></i> :<br> The type of the parameters sent to the task upon execution<br><hr>
<i class="font"><u>Progress</u></i> :<br> The type of the progress units published during the background
computation<br><hr>
<i class="font"><u>Result </u></i>:<br> The type of the result of the background computation<br><br><hr>

    public class AsyncTaskTestActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    // This starts the AsyncTask
    new MyTask().execute("my string paramater");
    }

    // Here is the AsyncTask class:
    // AsyncTask
    &lt;Params, Progress, Result&gt;.
    // Params – the type (Object/primitive) you pass to the AsyncTask from .execute()
    // Progress – the type that gets passed to onProgressUpdate()
    // Result – the type returns from doInBackground()
    // Any of them can be String, Integer, Void, etc.

    private class MyTask extends AsyncTask
    &lt;String, Integer, String&gt; {

    // Runs in UI before background thread is called
    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute() {
    super.onPreExecute();

    // Do something like display a progress bar
    }

    // This is run in a background thread
    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(String... params) {
    // get the string from params, which is an array
    String myString = params[0];

    // Do something that takes a long time, for example:
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {

    // Do things

    // Call this to update your progress
    publishProgress(i);
    }

    return "this string is passed to onPostExecute";
    }

    // This is called from background thread but runs in UI
    @Override
    protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... values) {
    super.onProgressUpdate(values);

    // Do things like update the progress bar
    }

    // This runs in UI when background thread finishes
    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
    super.onPostExecute(result);

    // Do things like hide the progress bar or change a TextView
    }
    }

<br>
<b><u>Note</u>:-</b><br>
The AsyncTask instance must be created and invoked in the UI thread.<br>
The methods overridden in the AsyncTask class should never be called. They’re called
automatically
AsyncTask can be called only once. Executing it again will throw an exception<br>
