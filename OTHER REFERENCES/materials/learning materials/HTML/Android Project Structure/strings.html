<b>Why to use strings.xml in Android?<br/>Why the practice of hardcoding strings is bad?</b><br/>

1. When adding your strings to strings.xml, you can easily translate your whole app into other languages.<br/>
So in the folder <b id="font">values</b> you would have <b id="font">strings.xml</b> with this content:<br/>
	&emsp;&emsp;<i id="font">&lt;string name=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/string&gt;</i><br/>
In <b id="font">values-fr</b> a <b id="font">strings.xml</b> with this content:<br/>
	&emsp;&emsp;<i id="font">&lt;string name=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;Bonjour&lt;/string&gt;</i><br/>
This saves you a lot of work instead of doing this the hardcoded way.Android automatically correct the language based on user preferences, and you don't have to worry about selecting and displaying this language.<br/><br/>
2. Secondly,Suppose you have a string, let it be a title for example, that is repeated in every activity of your app. 
Now suppose after a while, you decide to change that title. 
Using strings.xml you will need to change it in a single place, while hard-coded values will need to be changed in every activity.
