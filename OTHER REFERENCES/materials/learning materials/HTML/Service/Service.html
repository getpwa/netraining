A service can essentially take two forms:<br><hr>
1. <b><u>Started:</u></b><br>
A service is "started" when an application component (such as an activity) starts it by calling startService( ).<br>
Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.<br>
Usually, a started service performs a single operation and does not return a result to the caller.<br>
 For example, it might download or upload a file over the network. When the operation is done, the service should stop itself.<br>
<hr>
2. <b><u>Bound:</u></b><br>
A service is "bound" when an application component binds to it by calling bindService( ).<br>
A bound service  allows components to interact with the service, send requests, get results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC).<br>
A bound service runs only as long as another application component is bound to it.<br> Multiple components can bind to the service at once, but when all of them unbind, the service is destroyed.<br>
