<b>Operating System:</b><br/>
In Android, the Operating System is <b>Linux Kernel</b>.<br/>
You can find the Linux kernel version running on your device under &ldquo;About phone&rdquo;
or &ldquo;About tablet&rdquo; in Android&rsquo;s Settings.<br/>

<br/>
<u>Functions of Linux Kernel/Operating System:</u>
<ul >
    <li id="headColor">Memory Management:</li>
    Allocate a memory to a new file, Free the memory when a specific file is deleted etc.
    <li id="headColor">Power Management:</li>
    Providing power to various devices like bluetooth, camera etc
    <li id="headColor">Resource Management:</li>
    It provides resources to each process, thus providing the ability to do multiple operations at
    the same time.i.e. Surfing Internet,Listening Songs etc
    <li id="headColor">Driver Management:</li>
    It handles installation of various drivers.
</ul>

    <li><b>Native Applications:</b><br/></li>
    Just by using Java we cannot interact with native applications.
    (Here native applications means that programs written in some other languages like
    C,C++,Assembly
    which are specific to hardware and operating system).
    Thus we need the support of native libraries for interacting with such low level media
    components.<br/>
    <li><b>Application Framework:</b><br/></li>
    The android framework is the set of API's that allow developers to quickly and easily write apps
    for
    android phones.
    For e.g we need to guess the state of a wifi.Then rather than writing huge amounts of code for
    accessing wifi we can just include a class called wifiManger which would look upon all the tasks
    related to wifi.
    Thus simply saying The Application Framework layer provides many higher-level services to
    applications in the form of Java classes.
    Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications.<br/>

    <li><b>Android Runtime:</b><br></li>
    It comprises of Dalvik Virtual Machine and Core Libraries.<br>
	Which we will be covering in next Section.<br>

<b>Applications:</b><br>
Applications layer is the top most layer of Android Architecture.All applications using android framework uses android runtime and libraries.
While android runtime and native libraries are using Linux Kernel<br>
